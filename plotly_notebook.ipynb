    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing data is as an important aspect in Data Analytics. It helps present the results to an audience (technical and non-technical) a clear and concise insights of a data analysis. There are several popular graphing libraries that are available to visualize data. Some of these graphing libraries are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Matplotlib\n",
    "2. Seaborn\n",
    "3. ggplot\n",
    "4. Bokeh\n",
    "5. Plotly\n",
    "6. Geoplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the libraries shown above, Matplotlib is the most popular and one of the first Python data visualization libraries. It is by far the most widely-used visualization libraries. Many other libraries are built on top of Matplotlib. Although widely used, the one drawback using matplotlib library is that it quickly becomes complex coding structure to show a reasonable interactive graph that can be done in a few lines of code using other graphing libraries such as Plotly and Seaborn. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial I will be discussing some of the features of Plotly graphing library. Plotly is an open source tool for building visualizations that allows user interactivity with a simple coding structure. It is built on top of Javascript and D3. Differentiated from the other graphing libraries, Plotly has options to have graphs displayed in offline and online mode. It is also equipped with an API that when set up can work seamlessly to have the graphs displayed in a web browser as well as the ability to save graphs locally."

    "\n",
    "## Online and Offline mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly can be used online or offline mode. Plotly provides a webservice for plotting graphs. You can use an online Plotly account to save, update and share your graphs via url. You would require to create an account on https://plot.ly/settings/api#/ inorder to store your plots online. Sign up for free and this will generate an API username and key. This account is now setup to allow python to send graphs and view data used to plot graphs on Plotly website.\n",

    "You can set up plotly in your jupyter notebook by importing libraries in the following code:\n",

    "\n",
    "You can setup to use your credentials in your Jupyter notebook by using the code above. There are two ways to display plots. `py.iplot()`and `py.plot()`. `py.iplot()` function displays the plots in the output below the cell. Whereas, `py.plot()` function returns a url that can be saved locally but also opens using a web browser\n",

    "Line charts are useful when you want to see the trend of a continuous type variable. In the code below I have shown trends of GDP per capita, life expectancy and genorosity of each country with respect to the happiness rank of the country. I used the `go.Scatter` function to create the type of chart. `mode = 'lines+markers'` was added to the trace in order to show how the data is viewed. We could use either `line` or `markers` instead depending on how you want to show the trends. The code below shows relationship between economy of a country, life expectancy of its people and generosity levels and its effect on the happiness score of that country. This is demonstrated using three different mode types show below. "

The data attribute structure includes `locations` show the countries that need to be displayed on the map, `locationmode` argument tells Plotly what kind of inputs it should expect to see in the `locations` column. In the code below we’ve set it to 'country names' option to treat the locations inputs as country name identifiers.`z` is the data that needs to be color coded on the map. In the code below, it is set to Happiness Score.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This tutorial provided examples of different types of graphs available in plotly. Plotly is a great alternative library to Matplotlib as it can produce visually appealing interactive graphs that can boost the quality of your presentation. Some of the benefits of plolty library are having both online and offline modes that can display generated graphs in the notebook and in a web browser. This becomes a powerful interactive tool when you use it with Jupyter notebook. It also allows to build comprehensive graphs with only few lines of code. There are many additional chart feactures along with widgets that can be built based on the charts shown above.\n"
